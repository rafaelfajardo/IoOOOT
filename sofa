Why a sofa for Casa Jasmina? Or, why not something else?

It doesn't really make sense to me to do propose or investigate something that already has a complement of sensors onboard. It also doesn't make sense to propose or investigate something that would already have a powercable attached. It does make sense to me to porpose or investigate something that accomodates/affords/rewards partnered living -- social living -- over an individual.
a chair is for an individual. a chair is a throne. a chair has been the archtypal investigation of the heroic architect. the sofa has more connotations of domesticity. a sofa can fit a couple. a sofa can fit three or four. a sofa affords/signals/enforces intimacy. a sofa drops boundaries between two or more people seated next to one another. a sofa should be comfortable.

maker archives already have chairs
flat pack chairs for CNC routers or laser cutters

challenges for sensoring a sofa
    what would we measure?
    to what or whom would we communicate these measurements?
    what would the power requirements for these sensors be?
    what would the onboard computation requirements be?
    
aesthetic challenges
    could we parameterize the forms/shapes to accomodate different tastes?
